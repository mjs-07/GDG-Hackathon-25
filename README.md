## Explanation

# Why Facial recognition ?? Why not fingerprint ??
    We planned to authenticate using face because it only requires a webcam, which cuts down the cost. Also, Fingerprint can be forged and erased.

# What if a person does plastic Surgery ?? OR What about identical twins??
    We have also got to know that advanced facial recognition models (such as FacialNet512, which we used) uses deeper embeddings which can identify the above said scenarios

# Purpose of NFC ??
    NFC card adds an extra feature of security and also reduces the time required for manual verification. Also this reducecs the jobs of manual verifiers.
